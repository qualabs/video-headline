1. Make the changes and compile using npm run build.
2. Copy the compiled CSS and JS to player/static/player/css and player/static/player/js, respectively.
3. Delete the old CSS and JS files in player/static/player/css and player/static/player/js.
4. In the player/templates/player/index.html template, change the names of the CSS and JS files to which the template points.
